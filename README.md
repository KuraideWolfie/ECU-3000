Description: <br/>
Operating Systems, instructed by Dr. Junhua Ding, introduced students to the concepts of an operating system and how they operate 'underneath the hood.' Concepts such as semaphores, mutexes, and file systems was introduced, as well as the ideas of multiprocessing and multithreading. Introduction to the Linux i-node system was provided, and more practice in C provided, such as by using malloc and free for memory allocation. (The concepts of starvation and deadlocks were also explored, inclusive of livelock and preventative methods and algorithms.)<br/><br/>The assignments of this course were designed for the Linux operating system; therefore, all compilation and testing commands will be for Linux. <br/>
